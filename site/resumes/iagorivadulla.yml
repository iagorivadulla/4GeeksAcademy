    summary: |
      Former professional chef with over 7 years of experience, now fully committed to technology and data science. 
      I’ve completed intensive training in Python and Data Science, learning to analyze data, create visualizations, 
      and build predictive models. I’m particularly interested in economic systems, simulations, and how complex patterns 
      emerge from simple rules. I'm currently building my portfolio to showcase my skills and curiosity-driven mindset.
